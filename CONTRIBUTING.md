## Contributing.md
#### Below are the current contibuting standards argeed upon by Aaron Neustedter and Professor Aref on 10/19/2018. Any suggestions are welcome
### Branches
- We will be using the typical stable/dev + feature branch organization, described as follows
  - Two pernament branches - master and dev
    - Master contains the last known stable working LIMO relesase
    - Dev contains new features and documentation that has not been review or packaged into a relase
  - One branch per feature
    - Each research is expected to have a few branches per semester as they add features to LIMO

### Refactoring:
- Refactoring is done in dev branch
  - While acclimating yourself to LIMO, stay in the dev branch, add comments, and commit
  - One the LIMO's biggest issue in the code base is the lack of commenting. Please help fix this when you are exploring the code

### Future
#### To add/discuss with Fall 2018 LIMO Team:
- Coding conventions
- Linter once coding conventions are adopted
- Use of issue tracker/github projects?
